 Can you help me ?
 
Hello everyone,
 
I have added a provider to my app but now nothing is working. I have following a tutorial to make that but I am a beginner and I have made many errors. Every things were working before...
I want the provider create a favorite section in a list view by a click on buttons which are in each items in my home view.
Can you help me to fix all my errors. Thanks !


I'm a young developer from 15. I would like to achieve my dream of creating my own application but I'm stuck. . . I can't solve my mistake with my provider. Can you help me with my problem? I'd be realy grateful.
